  - interacting with Shadow DOM in chromium based browsers
  - taking screenshots of elements and full web pages.
- Relative locators for locating elements above, below, to the left and right of another element.

### Building Quality Gates and Automated Decisions in CI/CD Pipelines {.slide-header}

::: {.notes}
* Quality gates - checkpoint where a project's quality is assessed.
* We have quality gates, it is us, if your team has a dashboard, it may involve looking at the dashboard,-
* benefits: early identification of issues, communication, risk management, informed decision manking
* around 6 minutes - take screen shot
* Lays out a roadmap for how to automate the decision making
* uses Report Portal - test automation dashboard
* nice demo of report portal
* I like report portal for collecting test result reports because it works across test runners and programming languages.
* I started putting together a report portal server for shiny server pro test cases last summer.
* If you are interested in setting up something like this, let me know and we can work on it together.
* screenshot around 34 minutes, what a quality gate's criteria looks like.
